  abstract = {The book is concerned with the statistical theory for locating spatial sensors. It bridges the gap between spatial statistics and optimum design theory. After introductions to those two fields the topics of exploratory designs and designs for spatial trend and variogram estimation are treated. Special attention is devoted to describing new methodologies to cope with the problem of correlated observations. A great number of relevant references are collected and put into a common perspective. The theoretical investigations are accompanied by a practical example, the redesign of an Upper-Austrian air pollution monitoring network. A reader should be able to find respective theory and recommendations on how to efficiently plan a specific purpose spatial monitoring network. The third edition takes into account the rapid development in the area of spatial statistics by including new relevant research and references. The revised edition contains additional material on design for detecting spatial dependence and for estimating parametrized covariance functions.},

  abstract = {A method is presented and demonstrated for optimizing the selection of sample locations for variogram estimation. It is assumed that the distribution of distance classes is decided a priori and the problem therefore is to closely approximate the preselected distribution, although the dispersion within individual classes can also be considered. All of the locations may be selected or points added to an existing set of sites or to those chosen on regular patterns. In the examples, the sum of squares characterizing the deviation from the desired distribution of couples is reduced by as much as 2 orders of magnitude between random and optimized points. The calculations may be carried out on a microcomputer. Criteria for what constitutes best estimators for variogram are discussed, but a study of variogram estimators is not the object of this paper.},
